# Patient List Manager

A desktop application for a clinic to manage its list of patients.

## Motivation
I first built this app for a family business, it's currently intended to be used by receptionists, so that if patients forget or lose their patient card, their record can still be searched for using their name or phone number.

Although this app was initially built for a specific clinic, I plan to add more features and make it scalable for other clinics as well.
